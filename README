MAA - Low Level Skeleton Library for Communication on Intel platforms

Library for C/C++ to interface with Galileo & other Intel platforms over:

- I2C
- SPI
- GPIO
- AIO

In a structured and sane API with port nanmes/numbering that match boards.

The intent is to make it easier for developers and sensor manufacturers to map
their sensors & actuators on top of Intel hardware.
